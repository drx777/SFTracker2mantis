== ABSTRACT ==

SFTracker2mantis is a humble attempt at creating a conversion tool for the sourceforge tracker
to mantis. The current state is not much more but a proof of concept and first working test.


== USAGE ==

# you will have to add every category, otherwise they may get lost
# to get a list of all categories, run
$ xsltproc listCategories.xsl sftexport.xml

# you will have to add every reporter with its username, otherwise the admin will be used
# to get a list of all reporters, run
$ xsltproc listReporters.xsl sftexport.xml | sort | uniq -c | sort

# to convert a sft export, run
$ xsltproc sft2mantis.xsl sftexport.xml > mantis.xml


== TODO ==
* try to add support for bug notes or add an option (config.xml) to concat notes to the bug
